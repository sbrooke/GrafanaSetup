# GrafanaSetup
My notes for setting up a Grafana installation in Ubuntu Server 16.04

StepByStepCLI.txt is a line by line script you can follow to get InfluxDB, Grafana and Telegraf installed in a Ubuntu Server 16.04  Those steps will only get the apps installed.  No configuration.

The Telegraf.conf file is a sample of the SNMP portion when configuring multiple SNMP targets running different versions.  Specifically, it includes the OIDs for Nutanix CE and Ubiquiti ER-X.
